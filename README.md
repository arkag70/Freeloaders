# Freeloaders
Freeloaders floating in pygame canvas
To run 
> pip install -r requirements.txt

> python main.py

* This is about a population who floats around the canvas. 
* They start as blue meaning fresh. 
* Hitting the boundary inflicts damage and their color changes from blue to green to finally red. 
* Red is when they're about to die.
* The initial coordinates, the velocity and the acceleration data of the
  last surviving 20-30% of the population can be used with a bit of randomness induced,
  to create a new population whose survival time will be significantly higher.
* The main goal is to use the previous data to train them to survive.
